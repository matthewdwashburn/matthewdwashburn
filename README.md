## Hi there!
My name is Matthew Washburn, and I'm a junior at Bethel University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. Throughout my educational career, I've discovered that I love learning new things, problem-solving, and working with teams. You can take a look at the code I've written in Java, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, Assembly, and Python over the last several years. Hope you find something interesting!
